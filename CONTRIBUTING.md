# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or suggesting new features â€” your help is appreciated.

## What You Can Do

- Report bugs or unexpected behavior
- Suggest new features or enhancements
- Improve documentation or code readability
- Submit bug fixes or small improvements

## ðŸ§¾ Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sonicfires2/NGA-music-player.git
   cd NGA-music-player
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```

## Making Changes

- Write meaningful commit messages if possible.
- Please also test your changes before submitting. I intend to make this work on both Window and Mac, however, I only ever tested on Mac, so if anything goes wrong on Window, please open an issue

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-name
   ```
2. Open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository.
3. Describe your changes clearly in the PR description.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, inclusive, and open to discussion. I hope that this will be a beginner-friendly and collaborative space.
